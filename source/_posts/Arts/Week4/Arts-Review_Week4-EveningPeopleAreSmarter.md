## [Why Evening People Are Smarter and More Creative Than Morning People, According to Science][1]
By Melissa Chu

You know how people associate sleeping in with laziness?
你知道人们是怎么把睡觉和懒惰联系在一起的吗？

I used to have a terrible habit of not going to bed until the early hours of the morning. Whether I was up all night doing work, studying, surfing the net, or reading articles, it always felt like there weren’t enough hours in the day.
我以前有一个很坏的习惯，就是不上床睡觉，直到凌晨。不管我整晚都在做工作、学习、上网或阅读文章，总感觉一天中没有足够的时间。

Besides, I seemed to feel more awake at 2 a.m. than at 9 a.m. While most people had their lights out, there I was, wide awake at my computer.
此外，我在凌晨2点时似乎比上午9点更清醒。当大多数人都把灯关掉的时候，我却在电脑前完全清醒。

Unfortunately, I would wake up the next day and realize that most of the morning had gone. Not to mention, people often associated my late rising habit with laziness.
很不幸，当我我第二天醒来时，意识到大部分的早晨已经过去了。更不用说，人们总是把我的晚起的习惯和懒惰联系在一起。

If you’ve ever been in the same boat as me, there’s good news.
如果你曾经和我有同样的遭遇，那就有好消息了。

People who sleep and wake up late tend to be smarter.
Psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa set out to determine whether children’s sleeping habits correlated with intelligence. He recruited 20,745 adolescents from 80 high schools and 52 middle schools for his study.
晚睡晚起的人往往更聪明一些。
心理学家Satoshi Kanazawa开始着手研究儿童的睡眠习惯是否与智力有关。他从80所高中和52所中学招募了 20,745名青少年为他的研究工作。

The first meeting took place in their homes, where the students were asked to take an intelligence test. Five years later, he interviewed 15,197 of the original respondents again. This time, they reported when they went to bed and when they woke up on both the weekdays and weekends.
第一次会议在他们的家里举行，学生们被要求进行智力测试。五年后，他又采访了15,197名原报名参与的志愿者。这一次，他们报告了他们上床睡觉的时间，包括他们在工作日和周末都醒来的时间。

He found that people with high intelligence are likelier to be night owls. This applied across a wide span of demographic variables, such as ethnicity, education, and religion. As Kanazawa explains it, sleeping late at night was rare back in our ancestors’ day, making it “evolutionarily novel.”
他发现智商高的人更有可能成为夜猫子。这适用于广泛的人口统计学变量，如种族、教育和宗教。正如Kanazawa所说的那样，在我们的祖先的日子里，晚睡是很少见的，这使它成为“进化的小说”。

Evolutionarily novel — is a good thing, as his research suggests that intelligent people are more likely to adapt such behaviors.
从进化的角度来看，这是一件好事，因为他的研究表明，聪明的人更有可能去适应这种行为。

How’s that for waking up late? But there’s more.
起床晚又怎么样呢？接下来还有更多。

Night owls are mentally alert for a longer part of the day than early birds.
People tend to think night owls are unproductive creatures since they sleep in while the early birds are already sitting at their desks. A 2009 study, however, shows that the opposite is true.
夜猫子在思维敏捷的时间的保持上要比早起的鸟儿有更长的时间。
人们倾向于认为夜猫子是一种没有效率的生物，因为他们睡觉的时候，早起的鸟儿已经坐在他们的办公桌前。然而，2009年的一项研究表明，事实恰恰相反。

Researchers at the University of Liege in Belgium monitored 15 extreme night owls and 16 extreme early birds in a lab. The volunteers had their brain activity measured an hour and a half after waking up, and again 10.5 hours after waking up.
比利时Liege大学的研究人员在实验室里监测了15个极端的夜猫子和16个极端的早起鸟，这些志愿者在醒来后1.5小时后的大脑活动，醒来后10个小时的大脑活动。

In the morning test, the early birds and the night owls performed nearly the same in their responsiveness. But there was a gap 10.5 hours later: the night owls later showed faster reaction times and were more awake than the early birds.
在早晨的测试中，早期的鸟类和夜猫子在反应能力上几乎是一样的。但10个小时后出现了一个差异：夜猫子们的反应时间比早起的鸟儿要快，而且比早起的鸟儿更清醒。

Appearances can be deceiving. While the early risers look like they’re hard at work throughout the day, the night owls seem to be more consistent overall in their productivity levels.
外表可能是骗人的。虽然早起的人看起来一整天都在努力工作，但夜猫子们在他们的生产力水平上似乎更加一致。

Working late at night helps people find creative solutions.
Researchers at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Miami found that evening-oriented people are also more creative than their morning and intermediate counterparts.
在深夜工作可以帮助人们找到创造性的解决方案。
迈阿密圣心天主教大学的研究人员发现，即使是面向人的人也比他们的早起和介于中间的人更有创造力。

As Professor Marina Giampietro explains,
正如Marina Giampietro教授所解释的那样，

“[being in a nocturnal environment] may encourage the development of a non-conventional spirit and of the ability to find alternative and original solutions.”
Not only are evening types smarter, but their unusual habits also help them to find creative solutions and alternatives. Non-conventional spirit, indeed. Who wouldn’t want to be a night owl?
“在夜间活动环境中，可能会鼓励非传统精神的发展，以及寻找替代和原始解决方案的能力。”
夜猫子们不仅更聪明，而且他们不同寻常的习惯也帮助他们找到创造性的解决方案和替代方案。非传统的精神,是的。谁不想当夜猫子？

Quick disclaimer about that last part, though. Whether you’re morning or evening-oriented is dictated by genetics, not by choice. As it turns out, a small group of brain cells is in charge of our internal clock and preferences for the time of day.
不过，关于最后一部分的免责声明。无论你是早起还是晚起，都是由基因决定的，而不是由选择决定的。事实证明，一小群脑细胞负责我们的生物钟和一天中的时间偏好。

So, what’s the key takeaway from all this?
那么，这一切的关键是什么呢？

Work according to your energy levels.
As a night owl, it’s easy to feel pressured into working “normal” hours. That is, according to the standard workday of 9 am to 5 pm. But some of us aren’t built like that.
根据你的精力水平工作。
作为一个夜猫子，你很容易感到有压力在“正常”的工作时间。也就是每天早上9点到下午5点的标准工作日。但是我们中的一些人并不是这样的。

Some people work better at midnight, while others do their best work early in the morning. And, of course, there are those who lie somewhere in between.
有些人在午夜工作得更好，而另一些人则在清晨做最好的工作。当然，也有一些人介于两者之间。

So if you tend to get your best ideas at a certain time of the day, take advantage of it and use that period to perform your most important tasks.
因此，如果你倾向于在一天中的某一时刻得到最好的想法，利用它，利用这段时间来完成你最重要的任务。

You shouldn’t feel like you have to work or sleep according to a preconceived notion of working hours. If you freelance or work independently, this shouldn’t be too difficult to achieve. If you work in a full-time job, see if your boss is open to the idea of you working remotely from time to time.
你不应该觉得你必须按照预先设想的工作时间来工作或睡觉。如果你是自由职业者或者独立工作者，这不难实现。如果你在一份全职工作中工作，看看你的老板是否对你时不时地远程工作的想法持开放态度。

The bottom line is: pay attention to your energy levels during the day and work with, rather than against it.
底线是：关注你白天的精力水平，并与之合作，而不是对抗它。

The next time someone criticizes you for waking up late, remind that person that you’re not lazy, you’re evolutionarily progressive. Nighttime is for those who create, innovate and think out of the box.
下次有人批评你起床晚了，提醒那个人你不是懒惰，而是进化的进步。夜晚是属于那些创造，创新和跳出思维定势思考的人。
